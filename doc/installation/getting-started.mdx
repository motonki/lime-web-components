## Prerequisites

To start developing Lime Web Components, you need to have the following installed:

- [Python 3 and lime-project](https://prime.lime.tech/products/limecrm/getstarted)
- [node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)

We recommend using the latest version of npm and lime-project, and the LTS version of Node.js.

**Please note:** npm is installed with the Node.js installation. Do not check the box "Automatically install the necessary tools..." during installation, since this will install Python 2.7 among other things you don't need.

## Creating a new web component

To create a new web component you need a plugin created with `lime-project`. Once a plugin has been created, a new web component can be created by executing the following from the plugin root directory:

```sh
lime-project generate web-component <my-component>
```

where `<my-component>` is the name of the component.

## Starting the dev environment

Once a web component has been created, go to the `<plugin_module>/frontend` directory inside the plugin and run:

```sh
npm install
```

Then restart the Lime CRM Webserver and run:

```sh
npm start
```

This command will create a development build of your web-component and watch for any changes in the `frontend` folder.
